About this
====
This is a challenge project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) so I can test my JS abilities, to build an interactive pricing component complete with custom range input slider and pricing toggle.
Also, I have to build this application using only the preview images and the especifications below.

Feel free to use this!

The challenge
-------------

Your challenge is to build out this interactive pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)


Page view and pricing totals
----------------------------

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.
